      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I'm originally from Terre Haute, Indiana and I started playing the guitar at the age of 12. Played in a local rock band for about seven years. Some time after my cover band days were over, I dicovered a four track player and began writing my own music instead of covering songs. It is something that I continue to do to this day and love the creative journey that it takes me on. I soon replaced my four track player with FL Studio and then to Cubase 7. Long ago my idea of getting the mix levels right was making sure that my amp was louder than everyone else's amp. I am humbled by the great amount of work that sound engineers put into making an ablum.</p>
